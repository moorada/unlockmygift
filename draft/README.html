  <p>
    <strong>UnlockMyGift</strong> is a fun web application that lets you create a series of riddles or questions
    to “lock” a gift, and then challenge your friends or family to “unlock” it by solving your puzzle. It’s an
    exciting way to add mystery to gift-giving!

  <h2>Why You’ll Love UnlockMyGift</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Add Mystery to Your Gifts</strong><br />
      Instead of handing someone a present directly, you can wrap it in a series of riddles.
      Only those who guess all the answers correctly can “unlock” their gift!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Easily Create Your Puzzle</strong><br />
      Use the <em>Generator</em> page to build your own quiz. Add images, multiple correct answers,
      and custom messages. You can even include witty remarks for when a guess is wrong!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Share the .unlock File</strong><br />
      Once your quiz is ready, a <code>.unlock</code> file is generated. Simply send that file to your friend,
      or host it anywhere you like.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Play the Quiz</strong><br />
      The recipient opens the <em>Unlocker</em> page, uploads the <code>.unlock</code> file, and attempts
      to solve the riddles. They’ll see fun or snarky messages when they get an answer wrong,
      and a triumphant reveal if they answer everything correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-language Support</strong><br />
      Both the Generator and the Unlocker support English, Spanish, French, and Italian.
      A quick click on any flag changes the entire UI language on the fly.
    </li>
  </ol>

      <strong>How to Play</strong><br />
      Your friend goes to the
      <a href="https://moorada.github.io/unlockmygift/unlocker.html">UnlockMyGift Unlocker</a>.<br />
      They upload the <code>.unlock</code> file.<br />
      They’ll see the quiz info, start the questions, and must guess each one.<br />
      If they mess up, they’ll see one of the fun “wrong answer” messages you created!<br />
      If they succeed, they’ll see the final message you set and (hopefully) receive their physical or digital gift.
